# On-Call Rota Script

This is a Bash script that helps determine the on-call user for a specific date based on a pre-defined rota. It displays the on-call user for the week or indicates if no on-call user is found for the current date.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.

2. Open the script file `on_call_rota.sh` in a text editor.

3. Modify the `rota` variable in the script to include the desired rota data. Make sure to follow the specified format for each entry, including the date and name of the on-call user.

4. Save the script file.

5. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

6. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   ./on_call_rota.sh
   ```

7. The script will display the on-call user for the week or indicate if no on-call user is found for the current date.

## Example Output

Running the script may produce output similar to the following:

```
on_call: Tee Micro
Tee Micro, you are on call this week.
```

In this example, the script determined that the user "Tee Micro" is on call for the current date and displayed a dialog indicating the on-call status.

Feel free to customize and use the script according to your needs.
