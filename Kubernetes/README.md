## Pod Commands

### 1. Create a Pod

To create a Pod in Kubernetes, use the `kubectl create` command with the YAML file containing the Pod definition.

Example:
```bash
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
```

Make sure to replace `pod.yaml` with the actual path to your Pod YAML file.

### 2. Get Pod Information

To get information about Pods in your cluster, use the `kubectl get pods` command.

Example:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

This will list all the Pods running in the current namespace.

### 3. Delete a Pod

To delete a Pod, use the `kubectl delete pod` command followed by the name of the Pod.

Example:
```bash
kubectl delete pod my-pod
```

Replace `my-pod` with the actual name of the Pod you want to delete.

## ReplicaSet Commands

### 1. Create a ReplicaSet

To create a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes, use the `kubectl create` command with the YAML file containing the ReplicaSet definition.

Example:
```bash
kubectl create -f replicaset.yaml
```

Replace `replicaset.yaml` with the actual path to your ReplicaSet YAML file.

### 2. Get ReplicaSet Information

To get information about ReplicaSets in your cluster, use the `kubectl get replicasets` command.

Example:
```bash
kubectl get replicasets
```

This will list all the ReplicaSets running in the current namespace.

### 3. Scale a ReplicaSet

To scale the number of replicas in a ReplicaSet, use the `kubectl scale` command followed by the desired number of replicas and the name of the ReplicaSet.

Example:
```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=5 replicaset my-replicaset
```

Replace `5` with the desired number of replicas and `my-replicaset` with the actual name of the ReplicaSet.

## Deployment Commands

### 1. Create a Deployment

To create a Deployment in Kubernetes, use the `kubectl create` command with the YAML file containing the Deployment definition.

Example:
```bash
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
```

Replace `deployment.yaml` with the actual path to your Deployment YAML file.

### 2. Get Deployment Information

To get information about Deployments in your cluster, use the `kubectl get deployments` command.

Example:
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

This will list all the Deployments running in the current namespace.

### 3. Update a Deployment

To update a Deployment with a new version of your application, use the `kubectl set image` command followed by the Deployment name and the new container image.

Example:
```bash
kubectl set image deployment/my-deployment my-container=new-image:latest
```

Replace `my-deployment` with the actual name of the Deployment, `my-container` with the name of the container within the Deployment, and `new-image:latest` with the new container image.

## Service Commands

### 1. Create a Service

To create a Service in Kubernetes, use

 the `kubectl create` command with the YAML file containing the Service definition.

Example:
```bash
kubectl create -f service.yaml
```

Replace `service.yaml` with the actual path to your Service YAML file.

### 2. Get Service Information

To get information about Services in your cluster, use the `kubectl get services` command.

Example:
```bash
kubectl get services
```

This will list all the Services running in the current namespace.

### 3. Expose a Service

To expose a Service externally, use the `kubectl expose` command followed by the type of service, the name of the Service, and the port.

Example:
```bash
kubectl expose deployment/my-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=8080
```

Replace `my-deployment` with the actual name of the Deployment, `LoadBalancer` with the desired service type, and `80` and `8080` with the ports you want to expose.

## Namespace Commands

### 1. Create a Namespace

To create a Namespace in Kubernetes, use the `kubectl create namespace` command followed by the name of the Namespace.

Example:
```bash
kubectl create namespace my-namespace
```

Replace `my-namespace` with the desired name for your Namespace.

### 2. Switch to a Namespace

To switch to a different Namespace, use the `kubectl config set-context` command with the `--namespace` flag.

Example:
```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=my-namespace
```

Replace `my-namespace` with the actual name of the Namespace you want to switch to.

### 3. List Namespaces

To list all the Namespaces in your cluster, use the `kubectl get namespaces` command.

Example:
```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

This will display a list of all the Namespaces in your cluster.
