Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to upload and connect the Custom Screen Saver Script to JAMF Pro:

1. Upload the Script to JAMF Pro:

   - Log in to your JAMF Pro admin console.
   - Navigate to "Scripts" in the sidebar.
   - Click on "New" to create a new script.
   - Provide a name for the script (e.g., Custom Screen Saver).
   - Open the `custom_screensaver.sh` script file on your local machine.
   - Copy the contents of the script.
   - Paste the contents into the script editor in JAMF Pro.
   - Click "Save" to upload the script to JAMF Pro.

2. Configure Script Parameters:

   - In the script editor, you can define script parameters to make the customization process easier. For the Custom Screen Saver Script, you can add a parameter for the custom message.
   - Click on the "Parameters" tab in the script editor.
   - Click on "New Parameter" to create a new parameter.
   - Provide a name for the parameter (e.g., `CustomMessage`).
   - Set the parameter type to "Text" or "String".
   - Add a description to guide users (e.g., "Enter the custom message for the screen saver.").
   - Click "Save" to save the parameter.

3. Assign the Script to Devices or Groups:

   - Once the script is uploaded and configured, you can assign it to devices or groups in JAMF Pro.
   - Navigate to "Computers" or "Mobile Devices" in the sidebar, depending on the device type you want to target.
   - Select the target devices or groups to which you want to deploy the Custom Screen Saver Script.
   - Click on "Actions" and choose "Send Computer or Mobile Device Command" from the dropdown menu.
   - In the command options, select the script you uploaded (e.g., Custom Screen Saver).
   - Provide the custom message value in the parameter field (e.g., "Welcome to our company!").
   - Click "Send" to initiate the script deployment to the selected devices or groups.

4. Example Output:

   After deploying the Custom Screen Saver Script to the devices, the screen saver will be updated with the provided custom message. For example, if the custom message is "Welcome to our company!", the devices' screens will display the configured message when the screen saver activates.

   Example Output:
   ```
   ----------------------------
   Welcome to our company!
   ----------------------------
   ```

   The actual appearance of the screen saver may vary based on the device's screen saver settings and configurations.

Ensure that the necessary permissions and access are granted for JAMF Pro to run the script on the target devices. Customize the instructions and examples according to your specific JAMF Pro setup and requirements.
