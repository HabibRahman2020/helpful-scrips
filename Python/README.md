# Python Project

This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates various functionalities and showcases the usage of different import libraries. Below, you will find detailed instructions on how to use the code and explanations of the import libraries with examples.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd your-repo
   ```

4. Run the Python script:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Import Libraries

The project utilizes the following import libraries, each serving specific purposes:

### 1. Numpy

Numpy is a powerful library for working with arrays and mathematical operations. It provides efficient storage and computation of large multidimensional arrays and matrices. Here's an example of how it works:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform mathematical operations on the array
result = np.square(arr)

print(result)  # Output: [ 1  4  9 16 25]
```

### 2. Pandas

Pandas is a versatile library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions to efficiently handle structured data. Here's an example of how it works:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Alice', 'Bob'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 28, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Perform operations on the DataFrame
average_age = df['Age'].mean()

print(average_age)  # Output: 29.5
```

### 3. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a widely used library for creating visualizations in Python. It provides a range of plotting functions to generate various types of charts and graphs. Here's an example of how it works:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Plot a line chart
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Line Chart')
plt.show()
```
