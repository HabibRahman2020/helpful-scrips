# Random Password Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates random passwords based on user requirements. It uses secure random number generation to ensure the passwords are unpredictable and secure.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `password_generator.py` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `password_generator.py` file is located.

4. Run the script using the following command:

   ```shell
   python password_generator.py


5. Follow the on-screen instructions to customize the password generation:

   - Enter the desired password length.
   - Specify which character types to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).

6. The script will generate a random password based on your selections and display it on the screen.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of using the script:

- To generate a random password with the default settings (16 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters), simply run the script without providing any additional arguments.

- To generate a password with a length of 12 characters and only include uppercase letters and numbers, run the script with the following command:

  ```shell
  python password_generator.py --length 12 --no-lowercase --special-chars
  ```

- To generate a password with a length of 20 characters and only include lowercase letters, run the script with the following command:

  ```shell
  python password_generator.py --length 20 --no-uppercase --no-numbers --no-special-chars
  ```

Feel free to experiment with different options and requirements to generate passwords that suit your needs.

## Security Considerations

The script utilizes secure random number generation from the `secrets` module to ensure the generated passwords are as secure as possible. However, please note that no code can guarantee absolute security. It is essential to follow best practices for password management, including storing passwords securely and regularly updating them.
